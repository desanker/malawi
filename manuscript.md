## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The National Adaptation Plan for Malawi has been developed under the Open NAP Initiative based a country-driven and country-owned approach involve a wide-range of stakeholders from different entities in Malawi, building on equally participatory outputs that exist to support the national approach for adaptation. Malawi has participated in many adaptation initiatives for the last 20 years, both under the UNFCCC as well as through bilateral and national programmes. The NAP is thus not just another planning process, but rather an umbrella adaptation programme for the country, embracing all past and on-going adaptation initiatives. A notable contribution to this NAP are the outputs of a recently formulated SPCR under the World Bank's PPCR, which followed all internationally recognized standards of participation, gender responsiveness, country ownership and basis on best available science, to name a few. The PPCR programme came to a halt for Malawi soon after the SPCR, thus making the SPCR an orphan plan/stranded plan. The five major programmes proposed under the PPCR are sufficient to comprose a NAP, however, several other systems and priorities have been considered to supplement, and produce the current NAP. 

The NAP embraces an iterative approach, with updates to be incorporated as things change and new assessments warrant it. This is accomplished by creating a "living document", with continuing assessments that can be integrated into the NAP at any time, subject to approval by the National NAP governance structure. The NAP is developed based on the guidelines agreed under the UNFCCC as expanded in the NAP Technical Guidelines, and is fully responsive to all the guiding principles outlined by the UNFCCC and further reinforced in Articles of the Paris Agreement. 

The NAP will serve as an umbrella national adaptation programme, and as the source of input in the update to the NDC in 2020, along with an Adaptation Communication that will also be submitted to the Paris Agreement. The priority programmes agreed to in the NAP will be integrated into the GCF 5-year Country Programme, as well as a broader implementation strategy for adaptation at the country level through national, bilateral and other sources of funding.

As an umbrella programme for adaptation for the country, the NAP will integrate assessments carried out by different actors and will present outputs that can be used and serve the needs of the actors in their subsequent work on adaptation for Malawi. These include:

- Government-led efforts including in accessing financing from the UNFCCC funds (GCF, GEF, AF, LDCF);
- Efforts supported through bilateral support to government or non-governmental entities;
- Efforts under the PPCR;
- Efforts supported through non-governmental organizations or the private sector;
- Efforts that would be part of regional and global activities;
- Efforts in updating the NDC and in preparing an adaptation communication to the Paris Agreemen.

The NAP also presents a set of adaptation goals, objectives and targets, along with iindicators, in aggregate for the country, as well as for key systems.

To continue the assessments underpinning the formulation of adaptation plans in the country, Malawi has recently accessed the GCF Readiness Support Programme to further advance the NAP process. Outputs form this project, when ready. will be integrated into updates and revisions of the NAP.



# Malawi National Adaptation Plan

## Introduction

The NAP is the main vehicle for adaptation planning for the country, and encompasses activities at all relevant scales and levels, from the regional (multi-country level) to the national, sectoral, sub-national and local levels, including for specific municipalities. All recent adaptation strategies and plans will thus be included in the NAP as a master plan for adaptation, indicating what is ongoing and what remains to be addressed. [S/T reporting]

As a country with limited resources, most adaptation projects will be funded through international sources, with very little dependence on national budgets, at least to begin with. During implementation, activities will need to be well aligned and integrated with sectoral activities funded by government. [Link to GCF Country Programme]

There are many reporting channels under the UNFCCC and the Paris agreement that require information on adaptation (priorities, key vulnerabilities, adaptation actions, capacity gaps and needs, etc). The work under the process of formulating and implementing the NAP will provide the central basis for adaptation assessment and prioritization, and will inform all necessary reporting on adaptation, in particular, the update of the NDCs by 2020, and future national communications/transparency reports. [NAP informing Draft NDC in 2020]

The NAP road map for Malawi includes all activities that contribute to adaptation planning and the NAP in particular since the advent of the NAP decisions in 2010/11, and this is designed to be the guiding rail for all adaptation activities for the country and is the basis for support being received by all those in a position to do so. The recently funded NAP formulation proposal under the GCF Readiness Support is naturally a major form of financial support and will be used to continue the work of analysis, assessment, implementation and further planning. Support from others continues to be very critical for the success of adaptation efforts for the country. [Road Map]

The office of the UNFCCC Focal Point, housed in the Environmental Affairs Department, is the current custodian of work on the NAP and will continue to work with all relevant ministries, organizations and actors as necessary, maintaining and running the continuing process of adaptation monitoring, assessment and planning, the support the periodic production of NAPs. [National mandate, CC policy/law, Data Policy, coherence with other MEAs]

The NAP is a living document and will continue to be updated as the need arises, with a view to producing a formal updated version every 5 years. By the same vein, all intermediate outputs (stocktaking report, road map, assessment reports, framework document, monitoring and evaluation plans, climate investment strategy, etc) will remain living documents and will be updated as new information and new insights arise. [Wiki collection of documents for easy update, later morph into a DIVA – dynamic impacts, vuln and adaptation system]

The NAP follows the UNFCCC technical guidelines for the NAP process, and the collection of supplements to these guidelines as developed by different organizations and available on NAP Central.

Applies the NAP-SDG iFrame to manage multiple entry points and coherence with various frameworks being addressed including the SDGs, Sendai Framework, New Urban Agenda, Africa 2063, and relevant national strategies.

There are several major assessments conducted in the last 5 years, and the approach taken is not to promote yet another vulnerability and risk assessment, rather to build on available information and identify any obvious gaps if any. The concept of risk is adapted, following good examples from countries and organizations that have developed recent guidelines, including New Zealand, and OECD.

The traditional approach of arriving at projects as the main outcome of these assessments is improved upon by identifying appropriate methods and metrics that in fact support a risk-based approach.

#### Building on the unfunded PPCR/SPCR ####

There are several ongoing projects and programmes that address adaptation to climate change in Malawi, as well as main development objectives. The NAP will build on these projects and scale up efforts as appropriate. 

One approach to make progress on the NAP would be to build on the PPCR/SPCR that was produced in November 2017, but for which CIF/PPCR funding dried up and is now left to find alternative funding sources. The PPCR/SPCR focused on three important sectors of agriculture, fisheries and water resources, and presents five priority programmes to implement proposed adaptation activities. The process of developing the SPCR are similar to that of the NAP and follow good practice in ensuring full participation of stakeholders, gender responsiveness, and builds on national development priorities.

## Approach ##

The formulation of the NAP follows the guiding principles and technical guidelines as outlined in UNFCCC COP decision 5/CP.17. It embraces the country-driven, country-owned and iterative approach.
The latest technical guidance from the NAP Technical Working Group is followed, based on the NAP-SDG iFrame toolkit.

## Key Risks and Vulnerabilities
